This script is wrote by Python language and is used for molecular descriptor based on multiscale weighted colored graph (MWCG) theory. This molecular descriptor targets pairwise non-covalent interactions of molecules. For a given dataset, we first perform a statistical analysis to identify a set of commonly occurring chemical element types, say C, and for a given molecule or biomolecule in the dataset, there is a subset of N atoms that are members of C. Each atom is labeled both by its element type and its position. The classificaiotn of atoms into chemical element types is a graph coloring, which is important for encoding different types of interactions and give rise to a basis for the collective coarse-grained description of the dataset. The details of calculation of descriptor can be found in the paper ( Nguyen, D. D.; Wei, G. W. AGL-Score: Algebraic Graph Learning Score for Protein-Ligand Binding Scoring, Ranking, Docking, and Screening. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019, 59 (7), 3291â€“3304. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00334.)

In the script, there are three functions, rigidity_L, rigidity_E, and get_feature. The first function is used to calculate the descriptor with Lorentz kernel, the second one is used to for exponential kernel, and the third one is for multiscale descriptor with different kernels. In these functions, parameter xyz_data is the Cartesian coordinates of atoms in a molecule, and nu, eta, ka are kernel parameters.
